Melissa Yap
Founder of Hero Brain
Inclusive Education Specialist and Consultant
Hi, I’m Melissa Yap, the founder of Hero Brain.
I’ve always considered myself a lifelong learner — starting as a part-time teacher during high school, later earning my Master’s in Inclusive Education, and now continuing my growth through training in evidence-based methods such as Play Therapy and the Orton-Gillingham approach to structured literacy. I continue to learn so that I can bring the best, most updated approaches into my sessions, giving students the support they truly need to progress.
Over the past 10+ years of working in international schools in Johor, I’ve seen how powerful it can be when children are given the right support and encouragement to learn. I believe that every child can learn — but they need to want to learn, love learning, and enjoy the process. Too often, children lose confidence, become frustrated, or even develop behavioural and emotional challenges simply because the way they are taught doesn’t suit them. That’s why I focus on tapping into each child’s interests, strengths, and learning style, making learning meaningful and accessible.
I also believe strongly in collaboration. A child learns best when their “village” — parents, teachers, and support professionals — works together. That’s why I make it a priority to partner closely with families and schools, so that every child experiences consistency and encouragement across all environments.
At Hero Brain, my goal is to help learners build confidence, motivation, and joy through support in literacy, math, social-emotional learning, social skills, and school readiness. With the right strategies, challenges can be transformed into heroic strengths that lead to success in school and beyond. 
My vision is simple: to nurture growth, empower strengths, and remind every individual that everyone can succeed.










Tan Chee Ching 
Clinical Psychologist 
MAHPC(CP) 00358; CP1-0472 

As a clinical psychologist, I specialize in providing psychological assessments and interventions for children with special needs, as well as for teenagers, adolescents, and adults. Besides, I also share my knowledge through talks and workshops with the intention of raising awareness about mental health. I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Help College and went on to complete my Master's in Clinical Psychology at the University of Cyberjaya. I graduated in the year of 2022 and started working as a clinical psychologist. Prior to my graduate study, I worked for two years as a Montessori tutor and clinic assistant, which allowed me to understand and learn to interact with children as well as support diverse learning needs. 
My areas of expertise include psychological evaluation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and family support, all aimed at promoting mental health and well-being across various age groups. 
Since becoming a mother in 2023, I have begun to navigate the profound emotional and role transitions associated with motherhood. This journey has opened my eyes to the challenges that many new parents may face, and I intend to specialise in family therapies such as postpartum depression, family communication, maintaining a healthy and balanced relationship (couple or spouses) and different parenting styles. My hope is to foster a supportive dialogue that can help create healthier family dynamics. I am keen to listen and learn from others as we collectively navigate the complexities of parenthood, and I appreciate any opportunity to share and connect with fellow parents and caregivers.
